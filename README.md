# knowledge-hub
This is a repository of technical knowledge regarding various languages and frameworks for my own reference.

## Overview
GitHub provides an easy way for me to compile notes in a simple so that they are accessible across multiple machines. The repository will be split up into directories, with each directory representing a framework, language, etc. Each directory will have a *general.md* file that contains a basic overview of the subject. All other notes will be divied up into subdirectories and dedicated markdown note files. Each subdirectory should represent some broader overarching concept in the subject which encompasses several topics. For example, under a *java* directory, I might have a subdirectory titled *testing*. Each dedicated markdown file should be about a specific concept. Using the above example, *testing* may contain the following markdown files: *unit-testing.md*, *e2e-testing.md*, and *junit.md*. 

For a full example structure, we might have: 
```

└─── java
│   │   general.md
│   └─── testing
│       │   unit-testing.md

```
