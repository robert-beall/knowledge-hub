# What is Spring?
Spring is a Java framework that provides infrastructure support so that developers can focus on business logic when developing applications, rather than wasting time on boilerplate code. 

With Spring, you can build applications with POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and apply enterprise services non-invasively to those POJOs.
