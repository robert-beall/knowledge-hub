# Hash Tables
## What is a hash table?
A data structure allowing quick insertion, lookup, and deletion of **key-value pairs**. A hashing algorithm is used to transform the provided key into an array index. [1](#Sources)
## Hash Functions
Hash functions translate keys to array indeces. 

### Key requirements of a good hash function:
- The keys are assumed to be integers in a certain range, enabling operations such as division and multiplication.
- Can be efficiently computed
- Should uniformly distribute keys [2](#Sources)
